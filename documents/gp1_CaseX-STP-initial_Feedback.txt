Hi, CaseX team ----

Yet another awesome job on this Test Plan.

You have captured the intent very well.

Nothing to fix for this one, but keep in mind that in the industry you may
have situations in which the tests need to be even more granular.  I know
it seems redundant to, for example, split Unit Test 1 in section 10.1.2.1
into separate "creates a case" and "returns status code 201", but just don't
be surprised if it happens to you.

The module dependencies diagram looks good -- a nice way to show the order
dependencies!

You have 10% out of 10% for this document, which is an A-plus.

Nice work!
