
Hi, CaseX team ----

Very nice work on this Preliminary SDD!

Figure 1 is quite nice, and figure 2 shows the top-level use cases well.

A couple of nit-picky things I noticed:
1) page one says "Outline of Software Development Plan" not Design Document...
2) technically, use case diagrams are supposed to have a box around the system
   components, but I like the way this looks with the line colors
3) sequence diagrams should have the vertical boxes only where each of the
   objects are in control or are active; otherwise should be a dashed line.
   Also, the names in the boxes should have colons in front and should be
   underlined
4) maybe make one of the drawings just a bit smaller so the caption for
   figure 4 will be on the same page as the figure it captions

Great job overall.

Fix these items in the next release for full credit on the document.

You have 10% out of 10% which is an A-plus.

Regards,
Prof. Johnson
