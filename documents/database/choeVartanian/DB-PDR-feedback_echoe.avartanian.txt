Great job on this!

Very complete information.

I noticed that your "outline" TOC still says "Software Development Plan"  :D

ON the ERD, there needs to be some kind of association between the Victim
and the Case, as well as the Address and the Case, so that you can find all
the things you specified in your examples.

Good work.

Total: 10% out of 10% which is an A-plus.
