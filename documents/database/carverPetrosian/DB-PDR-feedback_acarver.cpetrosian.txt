Carleen and Andrea ---

This is a truly awesome job!!  The amount of detail you have here basically
means you got credit for both assignments in one swoop.  You will probably
need to update things a bit to make sure the design reflects what you've
built in the end, but OMG, awesome work.

The ERD looks great, with one suggestion:  Perhaps there should be some way
to associate the "user" entity with the "case" entity, something like a
diamond saying "accesses"?

You two did a wonderful job on this document.

Total: 10% out of 10% which is an A-plus.
